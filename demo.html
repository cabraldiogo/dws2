	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University. Together they own about 16 percent of its shares. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful",[10] and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil".[11][12] In 2006 Google moved to headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.

	<h2>Growth</h2>	
	<p>In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California, which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology startups.[67] The next year, against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine,[68] Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords.[26] In order to maintain an uncluttered page design and increase speed, advertisements were solely text-based. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bids and click-throughs, with bidding starting at five cents per click.[26]

	<h2>Other Products</h2>
	<p>Google Search Appliance was launched in February 2002, targeted toward providing search technology for larger organizations.[26] Google launched the Mini three years later, which was targeted at smaller organizations. Late in 2006, Google began to sell Custom Search Business Edition, providing customers with an advertising-free window into Google.com's index. The service was renamed Google Site Search in 2008.[178]</p>
