		The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (commonly known as Coachella, Coachellafest, or Coachella Festival) is an annual three-day music and arts festival, founded by Paul Tollett, organized by Goldenvoice (a subsidiary of AEG Live), and held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California in the Inland Empire's Coachella Valley. The event features many music genres, including rock, indie, hip hop, and electronic music, as well as sculpture. Across the grounds, several stages continuously host live music. The main stages are: Coachella Stage, Outdoor Theatre, Gobi Tent, Mojave Tent, and the Sahara Tent (2006 and 2011 also featured the addition of a smaller Oasis Dome and 2013 featured a new Yuma stage.)
